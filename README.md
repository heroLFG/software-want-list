# software-want-list
a place to list out vital software that is missing in our world

## Smart Digital Carts
- I want software that lets me create and save grocery lists that are in a universal format which allows me to easily go to an online gorcery store and fill my shopping cart in the least tedious manner.
- The idea could apply to things other than grocery carts.

## Elections on the Internet
- I have written much about this already.  It can be done and it should be done.

## Charity Gateway
- I need help link.  You can let people know what you need help with right now.
- I want to help link.  It would be nice to check on people based on your social network.  For example - how many people within 3 hops to my direct network need help with food?
